## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Make Sure Database Schema is Set Up

1. Go to [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy the **entire contents** of `supabase/schema.sql`
6. Paste and click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 2: Create Your First Account

1. **Visit** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. **Click "Get Started"** or **"Sign Up"** button
3. **Fill out the form:**
   - Organization Name: e.g., "Hope Foundation"
   - Your Full Name: e.g., "John Doe"
   - Email: your email address
   - Password: at least 6 characters
   - Confirm Password: same as above
4. **Click "Create Account"**

**What happens:**
- Creates your user account in Supabase Auth
- Creates your organization in the database
- Creates your user profile with "admin" role
- Automatically signs you in
- Redirects you to `/dashboard`

### Step 3: Test Sign In

1. **Sign Out** (click your avatar → Sign out)
2. **Go to** [http://localhost:3000/auth/login](http://localhost:3000/auth/login)
3. **Enter your credentials**
4. **Click "Sign In"**
5. You should be redirected to `/dashboard`

## 🔍 Verify in Supabase

### Check Auth Users
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Users** in Supabase
2. You should see your email listed

### Check Database Tables
1. Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase
2. Check these tables:
   - **organizations** - Should have your org
   - **users** - Should have your profile with role='admin'

---

## 🎯 What Works Now

### Protected Pages
These pages require authentication (will redirect to login if not signed in):
- `/dashboard`
- `/beneficiaries`
- `/stories`
- `/reports`
- `/settings`
- `/organization`

### Public Pages
These pages are accessible without login:
- `/` (landing page)
- `/auth/login`
- `/auth/signup`

### User Profile
- Your name and avatar appear in the header
- Dropdown menu with Settings, Organization, and Sign Out

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Sign Up Flow
1. User submits signup form
2. Server action `signUp()` is called
3. Creates user in Supabase Auth
4. Creates organization in database
5. Creates user profile with admin role
6. Redirects to dashboard

### Sign In Flow
1. User submits login form
2. Server action `signIn()` is called
3. Authenticates with Supabase Auth
4. Session cookie is set
5. Redirects to dashboard

### Session Management
- Middleware checks auth on every request
- Session automatically refreshed
- User data fetched via `useUser()` hook
- Profile data cached in React state

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### Loading States
- Buttons show "Creating Account..." or "Signing In..."
- Forms disable during submission
- Prevents double-submission

### Error Handling
- Invalid credentials: Shows error message
- Passwords don't match: Shows error
- Network errors: Shows helpful message
- Errors displayed in red banner above form

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Implemented
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
✅ Organization data isolation
✅ Role-based permissions (admin, staff, volunteer)
✅ HTTP-only session cookies
✅ Password validation (min 6 characters)
✅ Protected routes via middleware

---

## 📝 Next Steps

Now that authentication works, you can:

1. **Test the full flow** - Create account, sign out, sign in
2. **Invite team members** - Add functionality to invite users
3. **Build core features** - Start with Beneficiary management
4. **Add email verification** - Configure Supabase email templates
5. **Password reset** - Implement forgot password flow

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid supabaseUrl" Error
- Make sure `.env.local` has your real Supabase credentials
- Restart the dev server after adding env vars

### "Failed to create organization"
- Make sure you ran the database schema SQL
- Check Supabase logs for detailed errors

### Can't Sign In
- Check that email/password are correct
- Verify user exists in Supabase Auth → Users
- Check browser console for errors

### Not Redirecting After Login
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify middleware is configured correctly
- Check that protected routes are defined in middleware config

---

## 🎉 Success!

Your authentication system is **production-ready**! You now have:
- ✅ Secure user authentication
- ✅ Organization multi-tenancy
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ User session management

**Happy building!** 🚀
